BGP Looking Glass NG

This is a BGP Looking Glass system for multiple routers.
BGP Routers supported: Quagga & MikroTik.

The system provides open user registration and allows users to register their Quagga or MikroTik routers on the system.

With the registered routers, an anonymous user may lookup the BGP table, run traceroutes from MikroTik routers and do Whois Lookups on the WiND whois server.

This project was written for AWMN (Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network) but can be used on any wireless community running BGP and using the WiND database (https://github.com/wind-project/wind) 

This system can be used to troubleshoot and monitor small to medium sized BGP networks.
It hasn't been tested on routers with the full internet BGP table.


Requirements:

WiND https://github.com/wind-project/wind (only for the Whois lookup feature)
Tested on Ubuntu. It should work just fine on any other distro as well.
PHP 5.2+
MySQL 5.1+
phpseclib ://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/
Crond (for periodic router checks)
