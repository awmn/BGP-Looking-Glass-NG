Download BGO Looking Glass NG zip from GitHub and extract it to a web accessible folder.

Create a MySQL database and import the db_schema.sql to create the system's tables.

Copy includes/config.php.dist to includes/config.php and edit it appropriately.

Make sure you install phpseclib http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/ on your PHP's include path.
It's needed for SSH2 access to MikroTik routers.

Also make sure you have installed PHP PEAR Net_Whois (http://pear.php.net/package/Net_Whois/)
It's needed for the Whois lookup section.

Visit the folder you extracted the system.
It should load the dashboard page.

Click on the Login link on the top right corner to login to the system.

Login to the system with:
User: admin
Pass: admin

You should change your password right after logging in (go to "Staff" and edit the 'admin' account)

Then you may go to "System Settings" on the main menu to customize the system according to your needs.


You should also configure your crond to run the check_routers.php script.
This is used to check periodically all the registered routers to see if they are up or if the password is correct.

Add the following to your cron
0 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/bgp-looking-glass-ng/includes/check_routers.php > /dev/null 2>&1

If you have many routers or they are too slow to respond in time you may increase the cron run time to 5 minute intervals or more.


For the system to access Quagga Routers users will need to provide the read only password of their Quagga routers.
For Mikrotik routers a read only SSH user should be created for the system to be able to access those.

An example would be:

/user group add name=bgplg policy=ssh,read,test comment="www.routers.awmn looking glass"
/user add name=bgplg password=bgplg group=bgplg comment="www.routers.awmn looking glass"
/system logging set 0 topics=info,!account,!ssh

This creates a new group "bgplg" with ssh read only permissions and a user "bgplg" that belongs to that group with password "bgplg"
The 3rd command disables the ssh logging so the log window won't get flooded by the periodic logins of the system.
